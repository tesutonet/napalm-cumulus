NAPALM-CUMULUS
==============
This is a community driver to support Cumulus network devices in NAPALM. 

This project was originally forked from https://github.com/napalm-automation-community/napalm-cumulus. For roughly a year the project seems to be abandoned with zero commits. In that repository was a pull request from @andydavidson with work to support cumulus 3.5+ and napalm version 2+. That PR was never merge to the parent repository. It has been added here along with other fixes to support recent versions of napalm and napalm-ansible.

This module currently requires the latest develop branch of napalm in order for it to function.
